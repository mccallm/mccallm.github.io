## Summary

To meet the rigors of the NCI designation process, which are unmatched in medicine, Wilmot restructured its entire organization, developed a bold strategic plan, doubled its research funding, and adopted a workplace culture that emphasizes collaboration over individual performance. It also initiated new programs in education, training, and community outreach and went on a multiyear recruiting frenzy that brought in 30 oncology stars—many of whom were at NCI-designated centers—to lead basic and clinical research teams. These moves culminated in a demanding, monthslong evaluation process—including an on-site NCI visit—which scrutinized a 1,300-page application describing every aspect of the cancer center’s operations, leadership, strategy, and research programs.
