## Summary

Founded in 2015, the Goergen Institute for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (GIDS-AI) was one of the first data science institutes globally, establishing the University of Rochester as a data science innovator and serving as the University’s integrative data science hub. Over the past decade the Institute has greatly expanded its reach, offering a wide variety of data science degree programs, supporting interdisciplinary data science and artificial intelligence (AI) research, and fostering countless industry-academia data science and AI collaborations with economic and societal impact.

To celebrate 10 years of the Institute and look ahead to the future, GIDS-AI hosted a full day of events on Friday, September 19, 2025, during Meliora Weekend. We invited all of our incredible faculty, staff, students, alumni, donors, friends, and supporters to join us on campus to celebrate this important milestone.
